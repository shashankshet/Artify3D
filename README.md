# Babylon.js 3D Drawing App

## Overview
This desktop-only web application utilizes [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) to enable users to draw 2D diagrams and extrude them into 3D shapes. Users can manipulate and interact with the created objects by moving them and updating their vertices.

## Features
- **Drawing Mode:** Users can draw 2D shapes on the canvas.
  
- **Extrusion:** Transform 2D shapes into 3D objects using the Extrude button.

- **Move Mode:** Enable the Move Mode to translate and reposition objects.

- **Vertex Editing:** Enter Edit Vertex Mode to select and manipulate individual vertices.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

 **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashankshet/Artify3D
   cd Artify3D
   ````
## Open the HTML File:
Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser that supports WebGL (desktop only).

## Interact with the App:
- Use the buttons to switch between drawing, extruding, moving, and vertex editing modes.
- Left-click to draw or select objects.
- Right-click to edit vertices when in Edit Vertex Mode.

## Dependencies:
Ensure that you have an internet connection as the application relies on external libraries hosted on CDNs:
- [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)


## Browser Compatibility:
The application is designed for desktop browsers with WebGL support. For optimal performance, use the latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
